# Liri-Bot

this assignment is to tackle the liri bot which work like siri but instead of taking voice commands, the application takes in written commands and returns responses. although i could not get far with this assignment, i tried to implement the basic code for spotify but could not get it to work (work inprogress). The LIRI Bot was designed to produce search results based on the following commands:

node liri.js concert-this node liri.js spotify-this-song node liri.js movie-this node liri.js do-what-it-says Each command produced different search results as listed below:

node liri.js concert-this “artist/band name” Name of venue Venue location Date of the event in MM/DD/YYYY format node liri.js spotify-this-song “song/track name” Artist Song Spotify song preview url Album node liri.js movie-this “movie title” Title of the movie Year the movie came out IMDB Rating of the movie Country where the movie was produced Language of the movie Plot of the movie Actors in the movie Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie node liri.js do-what-it-says Print the spotify results for “I want it that way” stored in the random.txt file
